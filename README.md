## Purpose
Do you trust of a source because of what site it comes from, or because of its actual content?  Do you recognize the bias in the news sources you read?  What would you do when placed in a situation with unfamiliar reporting styles - would you even notice?  Are the differences between these sources even that noticeable?

The goal of this project was to be able to provide the reader with an avenue to personally answer these questions by changing something so automatically trusted yet simultaneously so impactful on our worldviews.
